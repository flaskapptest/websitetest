  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p class="lead">Alex Mednis</p>
</div>

<div class='container'>
<p> I created this site to host my resume and to learn how to create 
a simple app with the Flask framework.</p>

<p> In my free time I enjoy volunteering to run recreational games at
 the local seniors residence, which I do twice a week, I also enjoy
 scripting projects with python, such as this site, and I am looking
 into learning a more robust computer language as a hobby.</p>

<p> I enjoy cooking, and often experiment with foods I haven't tried
 before, as well as foraging wild foods. I have recently gotten my
 safe food handler certificate towards that end, as well as my smartserve
 and cpr, and looking forward to any further ongoing education courses.</p>

<p> I also have a passion for working with animals, I enjoy taking my dogs
 for a walk, and watching my goats and collecting eggs from my chickens,
 sugar gliders are of a particular interest to me although I have opted 
not to buy any yet as owning them is a full time job in and of itself.</p>
