  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  <p class="lead">This site was created using the Flask framework on top of Python 3, and hosted on PythonAnywhere</p>

  <h3><small>Why did I choose to host this site on Python Anywhere?</small></h3>
  <p> I wanted to use my <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> as a server for this site and use <a href="http://www.duckdns.org/">DuckDNS</a> for my domain name, but didn't want to open up my LAN up to the world, and really didn't want deal with the constant port scans that accompany that.</p>

  <h3><small>This site seems to be very simplistic?!</small></h3>
  <p> Yes!! This is by design, too many sites these days go overboard with the JavaScript, which is really lousy for users with a slow internet connection or users who use text only browsers. This site is almost entirely HTML, with a little bit of bootstrap for the CSS. I leave no cookies (although bootstrap and Python Anywhere both leave one), no JavaScript, and few images, for a snappy performance.</p>
